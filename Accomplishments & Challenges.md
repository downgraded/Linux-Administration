## Week ending 2/21

<b>Accomplishment</b> - Did most of the work for Sed, Awk, and Grep assignments. 

<b>Challenge</b> - Finishing out things that are almost complete after getting stuck on something minor. Sometimes when I'm met with uncertainty because there seems to be multiple correct answers I tell myself I'll figure it out later, which just leads to more procrastination.

## Week ending 2/28

<b>Accomplishment</b> - Worked on python networking script and took the opportunity to practice some things within python, such as passing/parsing command line arguments and parsing json data.

<b>Challenge</b> - Documenting everything I do as I do it, rather than going back and retracing my steps afterwards. This would save a lot of time because the information would be fresh in my mind, and the commands would still be on my screen.

## Week ending 3/7

<b>Accomplishment</b> - Cleaned up documentation, rewrote in markdown, and made everything more uniform. This should improve my workflow and allot me to easier document things.

<b>Challenge</b> - Implement more screenshots into future documentation and retroactively screenshot steps for previous documentation. It only takes a small bit of extra time, but will help save a lot of time in the future following the documentation.
